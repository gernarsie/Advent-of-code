## Advent of code

My <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> solutions using Python.

Started on 2025 so the order for the previous years is backwards (2024 -> 2023 -> . . . ) and have not been done during the event.

These solutions are far from optimal and done both as a learning exercise and for fun.

As requested by the site and author, the inputs are not included.
